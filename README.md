## DESCRIPTION OF THIS PROJECT
This project aims to develop an automated system that reads medical lab test results from structured data files (like CSV), performs basic data analysis, and generates professional, formatted PDF reports for each patient using Python libraries such as ReportLab or FPDF.

In traditional medical laboratories, manually creating reports is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale. This solution automates the entire process, providing fast, consistent, and accurate reports for patients.

## Objectives:
Read and process patient test results from a structured file(.csv).

Analyze data (e.g., flag abnormal values based on reference ranges).

Automatically generate PDF reports with:

Patient information

Lab test names and results

Reference ranges

Highlighted abnormal values

Save each report as an individual PDF file.

## Technologies and Libraries Used:
Python – Core programming language

Pandas – For reading and manipulating tabular data

ReportLab – For creating PDF documents

OS – For file management and output directories

Regex / Logic Matching – For evaluating test result ranges

## Input Format (CSV Example):
Patientid,  Name,	Age,  Test, 	Result, 	Unit, 	ReferenceRange

## Use Cases:
Diagnostic laboratories

Hospital management systems

Clinics that want to automate patient reporting

Educational or training platforms for healthcare tech students

## OUTPUT:
A separate PDF file for each patient with:,
Patient info (ID, Name, Age),
A table of lab tests with:,
Test name,
Result,
Unit,
Reference range,
Normal/Abnormal status,
